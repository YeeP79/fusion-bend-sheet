# TubeBendSheet Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

## Overview

TubeBendSheet is an Autodesk Fusion add-in that calculates tube bend rotations and generates printable bend sheets. This policy describes how the add-in handles user data.

## Data Collection

TubeBendSheet does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data. The add-in operates entirely offline within Autodesk Fusion.

## Data Stored Locally

The add-in stores the following data locally on your computer:

- **Bender Profiles:** Bender names, die specifications (CLR, offset, tube OD), and minimum grip settings are saved to a local JSON file within the add-in's installation directory.
- **Per-Sketch Settings:** Your selected bender and die preferences are stored as attributes within your Fusion design documents.

This data never leaves your computer and is not transmitted to the developer or any third party.

## Third-Party Sharing

TubeBendSheet does not share any data with third parties. There are no analytics tools, advertising networks, or external services integrated into this add-in.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- **Bender Profiles:** Retained until you delete them through the add-in's interface or uninstall the add-in.
- **Per-Sketch Settings:** Retained within your Fusion documents. Deleted when you delete the associated sketch or document.

To delete all add-in data, uninstall TubeBendSheet from Fusion. This removes all locally stored bender profiles. Document-level settings remain in your Fusion files unless you delete those files.

## Revoking Consent / Data Deletion Requests

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no consent to revoke. To remove locally stored data:

1. **Bender Profiles:** Use the Manage Benders command to delete individual profiles, or uninstall the add-in.
2. **Document Settings:** Delete the associated sketch or Fusion document.
