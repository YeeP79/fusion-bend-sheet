"""TubeBendSheet - Fusion 360 Add-in for tube bend calculations.

This __init__.py makes the add-in directory a proper Python package,
enabling relative imports between submodules (core, models, storage, commands).

Note: Fusion 360 uses TubeBendSheet.py as the entry point, not this file.
This file exists solely to support the package structure for relative imports.
